# Recursive Signal Recomposer

> **Tool 14 of 18 in the RCD Modular Grid**

The Recursive Signal Recomposer takes fragmented symbolic sequences and attempts to reassemble them into a coherent attractor structure. It models how broken communication patterns, traumatic memory traces, or low-fidelity symbolic drift signals might be recursively reinterpreted back into stabilized identity narratives.

## üîç What It Does

- Accepts semi-random symbolic sequences as input
- Applies recursive reconstruction logic based on RCD‚ÄìKCE attractor mapping
- Tracks coherence (`Œ≥(t)`) during reassembly
- Detects self-similarity emergence during loop iteration
- Visualizes how chaotic signals can reform symbolic identity cores

## Use Cases

- Post-trauma identity repair simulation
- Reconstructive cognition modeling
- RCD-KCE loop restoration analysis
- Broken narrative recovery

## How It Works

It recursively maps partial signals back onto a growing internal attractor surface using symbolic alignment heuristics. The coherence is tracked per iteration, and attractor deformation is visualized.
